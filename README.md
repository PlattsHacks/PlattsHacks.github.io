### Setting up SSL

We'd highly recommend looking into [Cloudflare][cloudflare] for SSL with your domain. It's compatible with [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and this project.

## Contributing

Our boilerplate is written entirely in [Jekyll][jekyll], which GitHub automatically compiles. This dramatically reduces the technical barrier needed to setup a hackathon website. We'd love to receive your contributions towards making this even better. A couple of things to note:

- We can't accept custom plugins because it's not supported by [GitHub Pages][github-pages].
- If adding any external images or components, please ensure you have the correct permission to use them.
- We advise creating a GitHub issue first explaining the issue.

## Dev guide
