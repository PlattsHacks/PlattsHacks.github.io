# MLH/mlh-hackathon-boilerplate

This is a hackathon boilerplate created by [Major League Hacking][mlh-github]. Using [Jekyll][jekyll], it has a extensible [configuration][config] that covers basic event information. You can then fork the website and have it hosted free through [GitHub Pages][github-pages]. It's free to use.

Advantages:

- Built in support for [MyMLH][my-mlh]
- Community-owned and maintained
- Free hosting through [GitHub Pages][github-pages]
- Discoverable through Google Search, Twitter and Facebook

## Contributing

Our boilerplate is written entirely in [Jekyll][jekyll], which GitHub automatically compiles. This dramatically reduces the technical barrier needed to setup a hackathon website. We'd love to receive your contributions towards making this even better. A couple of things to note:

- We can't accept custom plugins because it's not supported by [GitHub Pages][github-pages].
- If adding any external images or components, please ensure you have the correct permission to use them.
- We advise creating a GitHub issue first explaining the issue.

Take a look at [this](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to set up Ruby and run the Jekyll server on the local machine.
