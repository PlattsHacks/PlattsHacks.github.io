title: Our Theme for PlattsHacks 2019
---

“Develop Together: Technology that fosters community.” PlattsHacks would simply not have been possible without the great people and organizations that have supported us. Let us give back to the great community here at Plattsburgh!

Contestants can create projects that focus on bringing people together to win prizes and awards. Only the projects that follow the track will be eligible to win first, second, or third place prizes. If you do not want to follow the theme you can still win many other awards!
Other awards will be given for best first time hack, most fun hack, and most technical hack. We will be continuing to update our website so stay tuned for more! Thank you and happy hacking.
